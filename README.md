# Fdisks' Calendar app
Forked from
[Vinsol](https://github.com/vinsol/fullcalendar-rails-engine-demo-app/) All
credit is his for creating this wonderful engine and stacking up a sample app
for it. His work is MIT licensed.

### Primary use
This will be primarily used for UNM Tenure and Promotion Application, as well as
CAPS calendar

### Features
I intend to have, in the final version, the following features:
- Private Calendar
- Public Calendar
- UNM CAS Authentication
- Identification by UNM CAS session
- Simple WebDAV integration
